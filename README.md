## Overview
The **Automated Stock Price Pipeline** is an end-to-end automated data system that scrapes live stock prices, cleans and stores them in a MySQL database, and powers interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time market analysis.

This project eliminates manual data collection by using **Microsoft Power Automate** to fetch live data and **Power BI** to visualize it, enabling faster and data-driven investment decisions.
